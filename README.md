# Transforming Engineering Space: Evaluating the Impact of Generative AI on Team Dynamics, Ethics, and Decision-Making

## Overview
This project explores how Generative AI (GenAI) and Deep Learning technologies are reshaping the modern engineering workspace. Through a blend of **primary interviews, surveys, sentiment analysis, and case studies**, we analyze AI's impact on:
- Business decision-making
- Team dynamics
- Work ethics
- Conflict resolution
- Data privacy
- Job displacement

## Data Collection & Methodology

### Primary Data:
- **Structured interviews** with professionals across sectors including IT, HR, e-commerce, and transportation.
- **Survey** distributed to over 150 professionals across LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Instagram.

### Secondary Data:
- Research papers (Zinnov, Deloitte)
- Books (e.g., *Human + Machine*)
- Movies (e.g., *The Matrix*, *Blade Runner 2049*)
- Industry case studies (HSBC, Johnson & Johnson)

### Analysis Techniques:
- **Sentiment analysis** of survey and interview data
- **Descriptive statistics** and data visualization
- **Thematic analysis** for qualitative insights

---

## Key Findings

- **54%** of professionals found GenAI beneficial in improving efficiency, strategy, and decision-making.
- Ethical concerns such as **data privacy (35%)**, **job loss (30%)**, and **lack of transparency (19%)** were prominent.
- AI fosters better communication and real-time collaboration but requires **reskilling** and **ethical frameworks**.
- Use cases like **HSBCâ€™s AI-based fraud detection** highlight GenAI's potential in optimizing operations and decision-making.
